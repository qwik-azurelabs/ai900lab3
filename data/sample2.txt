Worst hotel with poor service
The Mirage Hotel, Jodhpur, India
6/5/2021
This is a old hotel (has been around since 1950's) and the room furnishings are average - becoming a bit old now and require changing. The internet didn't work and had to come to one of their office rooms to check in for my flight home. The website says it's close to the Indian Museum, but it's too far to walk.
